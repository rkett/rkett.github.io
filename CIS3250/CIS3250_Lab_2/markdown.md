# The Gantt Chart

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Henry_L._Gantt.jpg)

### Who

- Originally named the *harmonogram* circa 1890, coined by Karol Adamiecki ([1]).
- Repurposed in the 1900's by Henry Gantt ([2]).

### Why

- Used as a visual aid for project management.
- Good for simple to semi-complex dependency structures.
- Falls apart under more complex dependency structures.

# Identifying your tasks

> *“Right,” Holden said. “No coffee. This is a terrible, terrible planet.”*

### Making a coffee

- A. taking an order.
- B. getting a cup.
- C. getting a sleeve.
- D. adding coffee.
- E. adding milk.
- F. adding vanilla.
- G. adding the cap.
- H. calling out the order.

---

# Dependencies

- Some tasks will be parallel in completion.
- Other tasks will depend on the completion of tasks before it.

### Our Scenario

- A depends on nothing.
- B depends on A.
- C depends on B.
- D depends on A and B.
- E and F depend on D.
- G depends on F.
- H depends on G.

---

# Splitting Tasks

- Team members can work on different aspects of a project or assignment.
- It is important to delinate whom works on what part of a project.
- This can be accomplished using the Gantt chart, through Trello, or even a combination of both.

### Our Scenario

- Cashier can handle tasks A to C
- Worker alpha can do tasks D and E.
- Worker beta can do tasks F to H. 

---

# Time Estimates

- The most important aspect of a Gantt Chart !
- Making a good time estimate will save time later on.
- Make sure you give enough room to finish tasks on time, as well as their dependencies.

### Our Scenario

- A will take 1 min.
- B will take 0.5 min.
- C will take 0.5 min.
- D will take 1 min.
- E will take 0.5 min.
- F will take 0.5 min.
- G will take 1 min.
- H will take 0.5 min.
